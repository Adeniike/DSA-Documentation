## DSA-Documentation
 I created this portfolio during my time at The Incubator, where I dove into real-world data analysis projects and built up my skills through hands-on work. It was a chance to move beyond theory and really get my hands dirty with data — cleaning it, exploring it, and turning it into insights that matter. This space is where I share what I’ve learned and what I’m passionate about.
